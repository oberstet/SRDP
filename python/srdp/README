Twisted-based WebSocket/WAMP client and server framework.

AutobahnPython provides a WebSocket (RFC6455, Hybi-10 to -17, Hixie-76)
framework for creating WebSocket-based clients and servers.

AutobahnPython also includes an implementation of WAMP
(The WebSockets Application Messaging Protocol), a light-weight,
asynchronous RPC/PubSub over JSON/WebSocket protocol.
